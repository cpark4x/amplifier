# Phase 2: Non-Code Changes Complete

## Summary

Created complete GitHub Codespaces setup for multi-project remote development. All documentation describes the system as if it already exists and is fully functional. The devcontainer template is ready to copy to any project for instant Codespaces setup with Claude Code pre-installed.

**What was built:**
- Reusable devcontainer template with Claude Code
- Comprehensive user documentation (setup, usage, workflows, troubleshooting)
- Template documentation for customization
- All files follow retcon writing style (present tense, no future references)

## Files Changed

**Documentation:**
- `setup-remotedev/README.md` - Overview and quick start
- `setup-remotedev/docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Copying template to projects
- `setup-remotedev/docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Managing multiple Codespaces
- `setup-remotedev/docs/WORKFLOW_PATTERNS.md` - Multi-project patterns
- `setup-remotedev/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions

**Template Files:**

## Deviations from Plan

**Minor deviation:** Removed scripts/ directory reference from README since scripts are code files that will be implemented in Phase 4, not Phase 2 (docs). This maintains clean separation between documentation and code phases.

**Philosophy alignment:** All documentation follows ruthless simplicity - minimal, focused content with clear purpose. Uses retcon writing throughout (present tense, no "coming soon" or historical baggage).

## Approval Checklist

Please review the changes:

- [x] All affected docs updated?
- [x] Retcon writing applied (no "will be")?
- [x] Maximum DRY enforced (no duplication)?
- [x] Context poisoning eliminated?
- [x] Progressive organization maintained?
- [x] Philosophy principles followed?
- [x] Examples work (could copy-paste and use)?
- [x] No implementation details leaked into user docs?

## Verification Results

**Retcon writing:** âœ… No future-tense language (fixed one "coming soon" reference)
**Historical references:** âœ… None found
**Files created:** 9 documentation files
**Executable permissions:** âœ… post-create.sh made executable
**Philosophy alignment:** âœ… Ruthless simplicity throughout
