# Project Assistant: Your AI Project Completion Coach

**Turn project ideas into completed realities with personalized AI guidance.**

## The Problem

You have projects you want to complete, but:
- **Getting started is overwhelming** - Where do you even begin?
- **Planning is unclear** - What's the best approach? What resources do you need?
- **Momentum fades** - Initial enthusiasm doesn't translate into consistent progress
- **You're alone** - No one to check in with, encourage you, or help you adapt when things change

## The Solution

Project Assistant is a three-phase AI coaching system that:

1. **Understands Your Project** (Discovery Phase)
   - Asks adaptive questions to deeply understand your goals
   - Explores motivation, constraints, timeline, and success criteria
   - Continues questioning until it has a comprehensive understanding

2. **Creates a Custom Plan** (Planning Phase)
   - Researches best practices relevant to your project type
   - Generates detailed proposals with multiple approaches
   - Presents options and tradeoffs
   - Refines the plan based on your feedback

3. **Guides You to Completion** (Execution Phase)
   - Breaks plan into concrete action items
   - Provides regular check-ins and encouragement
   - Tracks progress and identifies blockers
   - Adapts the plan as reality unfolds

**The result**: A personalized project coach that helps you complete what you start.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Complete the [Amplifier setup instructions](../../README.md#-step-by-step-setup) first.

### Start a New Project

```bash
make project-assist PROJECT="Kitchen Renovation"
```

The tool will guide you through three phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- Answer questions about your project
- Continue until the AI understands your goals (80%+ understanding)
- Get a comprehensive understanding document

**Phase 2: Planning**
- Review AI-generated research and proposal
- Provide feedback to refine the plan
- Approve when ready to start

**Phase 3: Execution**
- Work through action items
- Get progress check-ins
- Mark actions as complete, blocked, or in-progress
- Request plan adjustments as needed
- Celebrate completion!

### Resume an Existing Project

Simply run the same command - the tool automatically resumes from where you left off:

```bash
make project-assist PROJECT="Kitchen Renovation"
```

All progress is saved in `.data/project_assistant/Kitchen_Renovation/`

## Philosophy

This tool embodies several key principles:

**User-Centered Design**
- Adapts to YOUR pace and preferences
- No judgment, only support
- Realistic about challenges

**Progressive Understanding**
- Starts with broad questions
- Deepens based on answers
- Validates understanding before planning

**Action-Oriented**
- Concrete, specific action items
- Clear success criteria
- Regular progress validation

**Adaptive Planning**
- Plans evolve with reality
- Adjustments are encouraged
- Focus on progress, not perfection

## Tips for Success

**During Discovery:**
- Be honest about constraints and past attempts
- Share your motivation - it helps create better plans
- Don't rush - comprehensive understanding leads to better plans

**During Planning:**
- Review multiple approaches before committing
- Consider resource requirements realistically
- Provide feedback to refine the proposal

**During Execution:**
- Do regular check-ins (daily or weekly)
- Mark items complete immediately
- Flag blockers as soon as they appear
- Request adjustments when reality differs from plan
- Celebrate progress!

## How This Was Built

This tool was created using Amplifier's hybrid code/AI pattern:

**Metacognitive Recipe:**
1. "Ask adaptive questions until you deeply understand the project"
2. "Research best practices and create detailed proposals"
3. "Track actions, provide check-ins, adapt as needed"

**Code handles**: Phase transitions, state persistence, progress tracking
**AI handles**: Question generation, understanding assessment, research, proposal creation, coaching

See [HOW_TO_CREATE_YOUR_OWN.md](./HOW_TO_CREATE_YOUR_OWN.md) for details on how this was built.
